StackenBlocken
==============

Get your blocks in order

A quick little game I threw together inspired by this Conan sketch: [StackenBlocken](http://www.youtube.com/embed/QEN5-_93gQg "StackenBlocken")

Using jQuery and the browser, with some localStorage for keeping track of scores, and LESS cuz it's awesome.

##How to Play

Click "Go!" to start the timer (you only have 5 seconds!) then click on the shapes and rotate them. The goal is to get them all as close to 90 degree angles (with the little arrow facing up). The closer your score to 0, the better.

Challenge your friends! [StackenBlocken!](http://davezatch.github.io/StackenBlocken/)
